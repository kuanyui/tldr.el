** Requirements
- > Emacs 24.3

** Install
=tldr.el= is now available on [[https://melpa.org/#/tldr][MELPA]].

If you don't know what it is, please read its README to setup MELPA on your Emacs.

*** OS Specific tldr Pages
By default, =tldr-mode= will choose corresponding os-specific tldr pages automatically by your =system-type=.

Assume you are using Windows, but you still want forcely =tldr-mode= to show pages for Linux / OSX / SunOS, you can use following:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq tldr-enabled-categories '("common" "linux" "osx" "sunos"))
#+END_SRC

** Usage
=M-x tldr=

Use =C-c C-b= =C-c C-f= or =r= =l= or =[= =]= to navigate in lookup history.

Use =SPC= to lookup another command

Notice that at the first time using, it will automatically download the latest tldr docs to local.

You can use =M-x tldr-update-docs= to update docs.
